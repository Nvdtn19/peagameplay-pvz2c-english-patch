## Features
- This mod includes 2 variants: English patch Basic and English patch Plus Edition. *Basic edition only includes translation and some essential features in-game, while Plus edition offer more extra features but heavier.*
- Translated texts in-game use Cafeteria font, same as the international version. Dave, Penny, HouseOfTerror are also be implemented.
- Some extra features.
