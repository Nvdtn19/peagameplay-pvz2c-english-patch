# Nvdtn19's English patch for Pvz2C
#### A mod for PvZ2 Chinese version that's aims to translate the game from Chinese to English. Created by me. With love ❤️

## Compatibility and requires
- **You need to have the lastest version of the game installed first.** See [here](https://github.com/Nvdtn19/nvdtn19-pvz2c-english-patch/wiki/How-to-download-and-install-the-game%3F) for tutorial.
- **This mod is compatible with both iOS and Android.** However, iOS has some limitations and the installation method might be complicated for some users.

## Features
- This mod includes 2 variants: English patch Lite and English patch Plus Edition. *Lite edition only includes translation and some essential features in-game and lightest, while Plus edition offer more extra features but heavier.*
- Translated texts in-game use Cafeteria font, same as the international version. **More fonts are available in the English patch Plus Edition.**
- Some extra features.

> Note:
> You must beat the Ancient Egypt day 4 first if you're a new player, if you want to use the EP Plus Edition. Otherwise, use the EP Lite or just leave the game unmodified to avoid any crashes.
