# Pea Gameplay's English patch for Pvz2C 
#### A mod for PvZ2 Chinese version that's aims to translate the game from Chinese to English. Created by me. With love ❤️ 

## Features
- This mod includes 2 variants: English patch Basic and English patch Plus Edition. *Basic edition only includes translation and some essential features in-game, while Plus edition offer more extra features but heavier.*
- Translated texts in-game use Cafeteria font, same as the international version. **More fonts are available in the English patch Plus Edition.**
- Some extra features.
